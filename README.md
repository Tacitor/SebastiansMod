# Sebastian's Mod

Sebastian's Mod is a mod for Minecraft Java using the Forge API. Development started for Minecraft 1.15.2. The mod adds a veriety of items and blocks to the game. It is mainly a way for me to lean new aspects to the Forge API. And it all started as a birthday gift to my good friend Sebastian.
